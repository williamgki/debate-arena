The anti-regulation side raises valid economic concerns but relies more on theoretical fears than concrete evidence. The neutral perspective offers the most nuanced approach with risk-based classification. Overall assessment: Pro-regulation arguments are more compelling, but incorporating risk-based approaches would strengthen the policy framework."
