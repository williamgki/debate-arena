      "description": "You're playing a game where you have to coordinate with a friend. Each of you can choose to bring 1 coin or 0. The coins you bring will be flipped, and if neither of them come up tails, you both win. But if neither of you brings a coin, you both lose. You are not able to communicate with your friend. If neither of you would be easy if you could bring a coin, and the other would not, giving you a 50% chance of winning — but you do not have this luxury. What's the probability that you win, if you play optimally? Assume you can't do any weird acausal coordination stuff etc.",
